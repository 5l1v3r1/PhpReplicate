PhpReplicate
============

PhpReplicate is a proof of concept self replicating piece of code for Windows server or Unix servers.
The self replicating part still needs to be coded.

Look in Parts/IRCBOT for working pieces of code, think of them as unit tests, the full project is far from finished.

Project is kind of also turned into a proof of concept server botnet, which communicates over
IRC and can also connect to IRC via SSL.
