IRCBOT:|
-------

This is an IRC Bot that will be used as a command and control center
almost like a botnet works.  I will try to make the IRC Bot to connect to
the IRC server over SSL/TLS thus their will be some kind of encryption layer between 
the IRC bot and the IRC server.  The infected server will still have a weird outgoing connection
on either port 6667 or some other port related to IRC. The more the malicious php code spreads 
on machines or a given machine the by replicating, the more connections to the IRC server their will be. Thus making
it possible to control the compromised machine even if some of the code is removed.

Most parts of the IRCBot will work on either windows or Linux, I will just have to adapt the command part to 
the specific OS on the given server.

When choosing a name for the PHP IRC Bot, use a random name (very random name) , because 
you will have several servers running the code and if two servers choose the same name when joining
then you won't be able to control both of them.
Perhaps this is a good way to eliminate the problem.
<- $randomNum = getrandmax();
<- $nick = md5($randomNum);


RedoBot.php just has some added features like connecting via SSL, you can run it in a VM with ubuntu server installed if you want to test
it, it works. Only responds to two commands at the moment and I should still find some way to format the output better so I can get the full console output
in a variable and sent as message on IRC to the channel, at the moment ifconfig will only return "eth0" 
instead of the full output.
