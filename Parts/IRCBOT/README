IRCBOT:|
-------

This is an IRC Bot that will be used as a command and control center
almost like a botnet works.  I will try to make the IRC Bot to connect to
the IRC server over SSL/TLS thus their will be some kind of encryption layer between 
the IRC bot and the IRC server.  The infected server will still have a weird outgoing connection
on either port 6667 or some other port related to IRC. The more the malicious php code spreads 
on machines or a given machine the by replicating, the more connections to the IRC server their will be. Thus making
it possible to control the compromised machine even if some of the code is removed.

Most parts of the IRCBot will work on either windows or Linux, I will just have to adapt the command part to 
the specific OS on the given server.
