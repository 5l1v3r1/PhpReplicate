PARTS File:
-----------

Everything is first tested before it is put together. 
The first few parts are:

1. Detect the OS of the server OSDetect.php

2. Check if system command is enabled. isinfo.php

3. Check if exec command is enabled. excinfo.php

4. Check if backtick operator works. 
I use ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 to show how external daemon /bin/ping is used from within a php script.
The output demonstrates that it in fact works.

5. Replicates itself.   mv.php ( Linux Routine )

6. Replicates itself.  cp.php (Windows Server Routine) Probably coded in powershell.

7. IRC Command and Control center.
   First I while just code something that connects to an IRC channel and reacts to one command.

8. Part that chooses what to do based on OS detected.

9. Entropy generator.

10. Obsufucation part
